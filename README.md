## My "Programming CV"

In this repo is my historical code, starting from 2012 (when I first learned programming) and organized chronologically.

For easy maintenance, this repo only contains small programs; my large projects are split out into separate git repos such as [jasha64/ARM9-compatible-soft-CPU-core](https://github.com/jasha64/ARM9-compatible-soft-CPU-core), and are hyperlinked below. Should you be interested, do check them out.

Contents:

**2012-2013** Basic C++ programming

**2014-2017** NOI

- "NOI" stands for "National Olympiad in Informatics", a series of algorithm competitions for middle school students in China organized by the China Computer Federation (CCF) [[Contest website](http://noi.cn/)]

- It's my senior high school years. I participated in NOI, won second prize in NOI 2016 Winter Camp, and won a bronze medal in APIO 2016 (Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad)

**2017-2021** Bachelor in Computer Science

- Course projects
  - Spring 2019, [Intro to Computer Systems](https://github.com/jasha64/ics2015): Completed an x86 emulator "NEMU" in C, which illustrates x86 CPU behavior and runs x86 programs like GDB does.
  - Spring 2019, [Databases](https://github.com/jasha64/DataBase-OnlineJudge): Developed an Online Judge with a MySQL backend, a PHP frontend, and an independent judger program.
  - Fall 2019, [Hardware Experiments](https://github.com/jasha64/Embedded-Hardware-Labs): Did experiments with battery stack monitor boards, somatosensory controllers, and motor control boards.
  - Fall 2019, [Intro to Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/jasha64/TicketAdvisor): An expert system, which asks users' requirements and recommend railway transfer schemes for them
  -  [Computer Architecture](https://github.com/jasha64/MIPS-Pipeline-with-Cache), [Computer Networks](https://github.com/jasha64/TCP-eBookReader), [Operating Systems](https://github.com/jasha64/OperatingSystems-lab), Digital Logic, Computer Graphics, etc. (Those that are not hyperlinked can be found inside this very repo [jasha64/jasha64](https://github.com/jasha64/jasha64))
- Summer vacation 2019, [ARM9 soft CPU core](https://github.com/jasha64/ARM9-compatible-soft-CPU-core)
- Summer vacation 2020, ["Vanilla" Pipelined MIPS32 CPU](https://github.com/jasha64/vanilla-cpu) 
  - A high-performance pipelined MIPS32 CPU core with caches and TLB, capable of running PMON BIOS
  - "Vanilla" CPU is our work in the NSCSCC Contest [[Contest Website](http://www.nscscc.org/)], and won 2nd prize
- Spring 2021, [Spiking Neural Network RTL Implementation](https://github.com/jasha64/SNN-FPGA)
