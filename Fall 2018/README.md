**Fall 2018**, 3rd semester

- The "Programming" folder includes some simple C programs, written when I tested some system functions to fully understand them. "Programming" is one of our compulsory courses; since I had already learned C/C++ programming during my middle school years, this semester I applied for exemption (not having to attend this course) and passed this course autonomously
